Here, we are exploring a core java concepts that help us to build a confidence while dealing with the core java program . we can learn more new things. and also learn that how to deal the program.

1. Java Fundamentals
Syntax: Classes, Methods, and Main Methods
Data Type. Primitive types--int, char, boolean, etc., reference types-String, Array, etc.
Variables: Declaration, Initialization and Scope.
2. Object-Oriented Programming
Classes and Objects: Templates for objects, encapsulation of data and methods
Inheritance: Process through which new classes can be developed based on existing ones that encourages reuse of code.
Polymorphism: Ability to present the same interface for different underlying forms (method overloading and overriding).
Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential features.
3. Control Flow Statements
Conditional Statements: if, else, switch
Loops: for, while, do-while loops for iteration.
4. Exception Handling
Try-Catch Blocks: Mechanism to handle runtime errors gracefully.
Custom Exceptions: Creating user-defined exception classes.
5. Collections Framework
Core Interfaces: List, Set, Map, and their implementations (ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap, etc.).
Iterators: Mechanism to traverse collections.
6. File I/O
Read and Write Files: Make use of FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, and BufferedWriter.
Serialization: Convert objects into byte streams; conversely, transform byte streams into objects.
7. Multithreading
Threads: Create and manage threads using the Thread class and Runnable interface.
Synchronization: Mechanism to control the access of multiple threads to shared resources.
8. Java Standard Libraries
Java API: Understanding about the most widely used packages like java.lang, java.util, and java.io.
9. JDK and JVM
Java Development Kit (JDK): Tools to develop Java applications.
Java Virtual Machine (JVM): Runtime environment that executes Java bytecodes.
10. Best Practices
Code Conventions: Nomenclature and coding and commenting standards.
Design Patterns: Generic solutions to common design issues. Example: Singleton, Factory
11. Development Tools
IDEs: Usage of Integrated Development Environments, for example, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans for the development of a project
Build Tools: Familiarity with the tools, for instance, Maven or Gradle handling projects
